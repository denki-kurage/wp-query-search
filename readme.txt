Display the REST API results in a DataGrid.


== Description ==

Check the operation of the REST API.
Create query parameters in blocks and display the results in a data grid.
It is also useful when you simply want to search for posts or taxonomies conditionally.

Use it on the post page, not on the admin screen.
Please post privately as nothing will be displayed on the front page.


Extensions (activated by pressing a button) should not be used in production.
You can add new items and edit them, but they are not yet complete.

This is for debugging.



== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/query-search` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
